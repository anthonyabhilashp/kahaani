# Kahaani - Story Generation Platform

## Generation Flow

The application follows a user-controlled, cost-conscious generation flow:

### 1. Story Creation
- User provides a prompt
- AI generates story scenes
- Scenes are reviewed by user

### 2. Visual Generation (Manual - Cost Aware)
**Step 1: Generate Images**
- User clicks "1. Generate Images" when satisfied with scenes
- AI creates visual representations for each scene
- Uses AI credits - only triggered by user

**Step 2: Generate Audio** 
- Enabled only after images are generated
- Creates audio narration for the story
- User clicks "2. Generate Audio"

**Step 3: Generate Video**
- Enabled only after audio is generated  
- Combines images and audio into final video
- User clicks "3. Generate Video"

### Benefits of This Flow:
- **Cost Control**: No automatic generation - user decides when to spend credits
- **Quality Check**: User can review scenes before committing to expensive operations
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each step builds on the previous one
- **Clear UX**: Visual indicators show what's ready and what's next
